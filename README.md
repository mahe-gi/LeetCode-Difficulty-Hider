# LeetCode Difficulty Hider Chrome Extension

## Introduction

The LeetCode Difficulty Hider is a Chrome extension crafted to improve your problem-solving journey on LeetCode. It's a simple yet powerful tool designed to hide the difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) of problems on both the international and Chinese versions of LeetCode. This extension aims to provide a more unbiased and challenging learning environment by concealing the pre-assigned complexity labels of each problem.

## Key Functionality

- **Sole Feature - Hiding Difficulty Levels**: The core functionality of this extension is to remove the visibility of the difficulty rating for each problem. This approach allows users to engage with problems without any preconceived complexity level.

## Why Install the LeetCode Difficulty Hider?

1. **Encourages Unbiased Engagement with Problems**: Without visible difficulty labels, you're more likely to choose problems based on your learning goals or areas of interest, rather than being influenced by a perceived difficulty level. This can lead to a more diverse problem-solving experience.

2. **Reduces Intimidation and Mental Blocks**: Labels like 'Hard' can be intimidating, and 'Easy' might lead to underestimation. By hiding these labels, the extension helps remove such mental barriers, encouraging a focus on the problem itself.

3. **Facilitates Deeper Learning**: Engaging with problems without a preset difficulty level allows for a deeper understanding and enhancement of problem-solving skills, focusing purely on the logic and concepts at hand.

4. **Simulates Real-World Scenarios**: Real-world coding challenges, especially in interviews, donâ€™t come with difficulty labels. Training in an environment that mirrors this reality prepares you better for professional scenarios.

## Installation

The LeetCode Difficulty Hider can be easily installed from the Chrome Web Store. Visit the [extension's page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetcode-difficulty-hider/bbhibadheonokoekdgmhemjimhfkingb?hl=en&authuser=0) and click on "Add to Chrome" to install.
